      <p>
        An ATS Resume Checker helps you analyze whether your resume is optimized
        for Applicant Tracking Systems used by companies during hiring.
        Many resumes get rejected before reaching HR because they are not ATS‑friendly.
      </p>

      <h2>What is ATS?</h2>
      <p>
        ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software that scans resumes for keywords,
        skills, and formatting. If your resume does not match the job description,
        it may get rejected automatically.
      </p>
